# Lab 4 Tower playbook Example

Example Ansible playbooks used by [Ansible Linklight - F5 Networking Workshop](https://github.com/ansible/workshops/tree/devel/exercises/ansible_f5)

In Section 4 - Ansible Tower F5 Exercises, we need to place all playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, before we create the a project. This just serves the purpose.
